When you download the Python file, place it in a folder with the export.txt file that Zoro/AniWatch/HiAnime gives you and make sure it's a text file

https://aniwatchtv.to/user/mal?tab=export
https://hianime.to/user/mal?tab=export

Run the script and it should give you a import.xml file then go to the MAL import page, set it to MyAnimeList Import and then add the import.xml file
