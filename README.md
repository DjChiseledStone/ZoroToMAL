# ZoroToMAL
DISCLAIMER: IT WILL OVERWRITE ANY ANIME INFORMATION ALREADY ON MAL.

When you download the Python file, place it in a folder with the export.txt file that Zoro/AniWatch/HiAnime gives you and make sure it's a text file

https://aniwatchtv.to/user/mal?tab=export
https://hianime.to/user/mal?tab=export

Run the script and it should give you a import.xml file then go to the MAL import page, set it to MyAnimeList Import and then add the import.xml file

https://myanimelist.net/import.php


## How it works:
The import file gives you a list of links to the animes in your account. Every link contains an ID for every anime. What this script does is extract the ID from the links and formats it into MAL's import file. The only information that will be transferred is the status of your anime, it doesn't keep track of how many episodes you've watched, number of rewatchs or any comments you made on the platform since Zoro doesn't keep track of those.
